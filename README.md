## Project Premise:
This project will simply display original aircraft from the Ace Combat series. With this I would display each Aircraft with their respective images and history.

<img src= "image.png" alt="aircraft image">


## Features:
* A list of orignal Aircraft of the Ace Combat Series with images of each respective aircraft.

* A search bar that is used to search each aircraft by id number.

* A button that shows the discriptions of each war they first appeared in canonically in Strangereal history.


### Attributes:
* id
* name
* image
* sortie
* description

### Languages used:
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* JSON

### Challenges I expect:
The frame of my project will be based on the GitHub search app assignent, but I don't expect for it work the same way, so I would have to do something different to make it work.
